### c. Test resume data using the classification model and classify each into one of the 4 categories mentioned above using R.

### d. Based on the classified result, each resume is compared with the top skills of the target title to identify the skill gaps using R.

### f. Build an interactive data product which allows aspiring analytics professionals to pass their resumes through the app and receive recommended courses that help them to fill their skill gaps using R.
